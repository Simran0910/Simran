   <ul>
     <li>Choose a safe online name. Pick a name that doesn’t reflect your complete identity or location.</li>
      <li> Have a strong password with alpha-numeric symbol and special characters for your online account.</li>
     <li>Secure your computers with anti-virus, anti-spyware and other cyber security tools</li>
           <li>Pay attention to the risks associated with e-mails. and think twice before you open attachments or click links in e-mail-even if you know the sender-as these can be used to transmit spam and viruses to your computer. Never respond to e-mail asking you to provide personal information, especially your account number or password, even if it seems to be from a business you trust. </li>
             <li>Never, try to meet a person with whom you’ve interacted only online without taking somebody else along and such meeting must always be in a public place. </li>
               <li> Periodically review your internet contacts and online activities. Internet housekeeping is important. Periodically review who you have as contacts, and who can see your online profiles periodically to prune out everyone you no longer have a close interaction with.</li>
                 <li>Don’t post personal information such as mobile numbers and personal email ids on social networking sites.</li>
                   <li>Don’t share your password with anyone or let anybody else handle your account. What is seen as trust or some harmless fun, can have severe consequences.</li>
                   <li>Ensure your computer has a good antivirus and anti spyware software. A lot of applications on social networking sites can be malicious, and if your computer is not well protected, it can result in a lot of issues.

   <ul>
     <li>Have an open conversation with your kids about safe browsing and computer use.</li>
    <li> Do not replace physical parental supervision of computer use at home with any safe search engine or any other tool. No search filtering software or tool is perfect.</li>
    <li>Educate yourself also on social media safety and have open discussions with teens about present dangers and long term effects of inappropriate conduct, including posting pictures/videos online.</li>
    <li>Keep computer in an open area. Make a rule that doors are always left open when kids are online.</li>
    <li>Parent should keep a track of persons with whom their children are talking to and which sites they are browsing. This is NOT invading their privacy at all , rather it is parenting in the digital space.</li>
    <li> If you have found inappropriate content about your child please contact the service provider concerned and/or Police as soon as possible.</li>
    <li>Majority of children would not like to tell their parents if they are bullied or harassed online for fear that they will lose internet access. Make sure that your children understand that they will not get in trouble if they tell you about a problem.

</li>
    <li>Explain it to your child that all Social Networking Profiles MUST BE SET TO PRIVATE. Use all the security settings available to make the site as safe as possible.</li>
    <li>Do not let young children to browse the ‘Google’ aimlessly with no supervision. Children need to be taught about search engines and how they work.</li>
    <li>Don't allow your child to use Apps like SnapChat that immediately delete the posts. Apps prevent you from monitoring the child's online experience and you may never know what he is being subjected to

</li>
    <li>If you notice a sudden change in your child's behaviour, to check, among other things, his online activity on Facebook, WhatsApp etc.

<h1>Cyber Security</h1>
    <hr>

<div class="row">
     <div class="col-md-8">
   
    <p>
      Cyber security refers to the body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. Cyber security may also be referred to as information technology security.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.

    <h1>The Importance Of Cyber Security</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Cyber security is important because government, military, corporate, financial, and medical organizations collect, process, and store unprecedented amounts of data on computers and other devices. A significant portion of that data can be sensitive information, whether that be intellectual property, financial data, personal information, or other types of data for which unauthorized access or exposure could have negative consequences. Organizations transmit sensitive data across networks and to other devices in the course of doing businesses, and cyber security describes the discipline dedicated to protecting that information and the systems used to process or store it. As the volume and sophistication of cyber attacks grow, companies and organizations, especially those that are tasked with safeguarding information relating to national security, health, or financial records, need to take steps to protect their sensitive business and personnel information. As early as March 2013, the nation’s top intelligence officials cautioned that cyber attacks and digital spying are the top threat to national security, eclipsing even terrorism.
